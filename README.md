## Introduction:
This project is an assignment in an object-oriented course at Ariel University. The project consists of two parts: The first part is an implenentation of directed weighted graph in python and consist 3 classes, 2 interfaces and 2 test. 
The second part of the project is to plot the graph using 'matplotlib' visualize it.

## Operating Instructions:
1. Download the jar file.
2. Put the Json files in the same folder.
3. In the command line, write the following command:
"java -jar Ex2.jar "NameOfJsonFile.json" "
